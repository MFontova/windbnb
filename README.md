## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

In the demo you can see a list of stays and filters section. In the filters you can search by location and by number of guests.
- What was your experience?
I enjoyed doing that challenge, because of the beauty of the design and the challenge of the filters.

I learned that when you see any input, may be it's not as you think ;)
